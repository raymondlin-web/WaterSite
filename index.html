         In the ocean, plastic debris injures and kills fish, seabirds and marine
         mammals. Marine plastic pollution has impacted at least 267 species worldwide,
         including 86% of all sea turtle species, 44% of all seabird species and
         43% of all marine mammal species. The impacts include fatalities as a
         result of ingestion, starvation, suffocation, infection, drowning, and
         entanglement.

        Water is a vital resource that we all require in our daily lives. We are
        not the only species that require clean water to survive, almost all
        biological life on Earth require water at some point in their lives in
        order to maintain their lives, so why is it that many people take this
        precious resource for granted? Is it because it seems so abundant, or is
        it that they suppose that it isn't their duty to keep the waters clean?
        We all live on this Earth together, so why should one person have any
        more privilage than another, especially when it comes down to such a
        vital, life-giving resource such as water.
